# React-Practice
 Practice projects for learning React.js and using API calls to dynamically update application data.

These projects can all be downloaded and run using NPM if you want to see an offline version of the application running on your local machine. None of these projects are currently hosted anywhere and were only meant to serve as a learning tool to hone my skills as a developer.

Most of these projects were built following Youtube tutorials
